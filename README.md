# Welcome to the SpendLess Daw !

**SpendLess Daw is a project manager designed to manage your DAW project files (currently avaible for FL Studio only)**.
It interacts with project files, reads and writes information inside them to retrieve, for example, the BPM, the title, the working time, the creation date, the VSTs used, and detects the samples used to move them to a folder dedicated to your project.

It has an **icon/color pair system** helping you visually recognize your projects effortlessly.
You can also add **custom covers** and an **audio preview** that will allow you to listen to what is in your project thanks to the **Preview Player** present in the application.

It also has many other features such as an **archive system, export, soft backup**, etc.

All these features help you organize yourself better without needing a complex manual organization and help you distinguish your projects from each other much more easily.

Finally, **this application is free and will remain so**. It is not excluded that in the future SpendLess could have a premium plan if expensive features are implemented.

However, the future potential premium plans will only concern these expensive features and nothing else.
This means that **no feature added for free will become paid**, if a feature is released for free, it will remain so.

The music world is already quite expensive, and we do not wish to contribute to that.
